          A site for my family to share our favorite recipes.  Many 
          of the recipes have only been on handwritten index cards
          for decades.  Migrating these recipes to the web has resulted
          in anyone in my family having access to them without having to 
          go through my mom.

          A simplified 'facebook' based on my housing group
          from college.  Our name was Sigma Phi Omicron but
          we called ourselves 'CRONS' for short, hence 'CRONbook'.
          This project was daunting at first, but when the back-end
          came together it became another breakthrough in understanding
          the potential of development.

          A terminal-based chess game written in Ruby.  This
          was one of my favorite projects because of logical
          challenges involved with incorporating the various moves.
          Unfortunately, I am still not very good at actually 
          <em>playing</em> chess...

      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>
        It's been a winding road to arrive at development.  In the past four 
        years I have been a minister, personal shopper, farm hand, and 
        an at home caretaker for the elderly.  Why would someone shift jobs so
        frequently? Because deep down I have always been motivated by helping
        others maximize their potential, and that can be done in any line of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few years ago, however, my wife decided to start her own art business, and it was
        <em>hard</em>.  I wanted so deeply to help her, but 
        I quickly learned I did not have the knowledge to contribute.  This is when
        I began to realize that having a desire to help people reach their potential
        is not enough.  I needed skills.  It wasn't long after when I understood 
        coding was a skill which matched my natural talents with the power to make
        a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, a friend of mine introduced me to The Odin Project, and 
        I dove right in.  The more I learned, the more I discovered how much 
        can be achieved in development.  Whether it's a small virtual safe for cherished recipes, or a 
        new sports fantasy app with the goal of changing the industry, there is potential, and room, for 
        everyone's dreams to realized, or at least nudged a little closer to 
        reality.  It has been a roller coaster of humbling, exciting, frustrating, 
        and rewarding experiences.  But it has led me here, maximizing my 
        potential to help others maximize theirs.
