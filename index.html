          A recipe site my brother asked me to make for my mom for
          christmas 2023.  He wanted a simple, easy to use site for
          my mom and others in the family to access our collection 
          of recipes.  She cried when we showed it to her, so we 
          considered that a success!

          A simplified 'facebook' based on my housing group
          from college.  Our name was Sigma Phi Omicron but,
          we called ourselves 'CRONS' for short, hence 'CRONbook'.  
          This site was a project to practice building a site 
          from the ground up, including models, views, controllers, 
          and data management.

          A terminal based chess game written in ruby.  This
          was one of my favorite projects because of the 
          increasingly intricate classes needed to represent
          the pieces, and the sense of accomplishment when
          it finally came together.  Unfortunately, I am 
          still not very good at actually <em>playing</em> chess...

          A simple RPS game played in the browser.  I love to add
          fun touches to everything I do, and here it took the form 
          of unnecessarily descriptive feedback.  But I am also an 
          aspiring writer, and need to get practice in wherever I 
          can!

          An ode to my mathematics background.  I had a lot of
          fun learning how to integrate mathematical concepts
          into the world of coding.  One of my first projects 
          but still one of my favorite.

          When The Odin Project assinged this project I was
          still a baby coder and it absolutely amazed me how
          much could be accomplished with a little JS.  Little
          did I know how little I knew, but this project still
          reminds that no matter how much I understand, more
          is always possible.
