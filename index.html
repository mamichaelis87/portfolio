          A recipe site my brother asked me to make for our mom for
          christmas 2023.  She still uses the original hand-written
          recipe cards and he wanted to incoroporate that sentimentality,
          while creating a lasting record of all the recipes handed down 
          through the generations.  It would also be a quick and easy way 
          for her to find recipes she wants to make.

          A simplified 'facebook' based on my housing group
          from college.  Our name was Sigma Phi Omicron but
          we called ourselves 'CRONS' for short, hence 'CRONbook'.
          This project was daunting at first, but when the back-end
          came together is when I started becoming confident that I can 
          really be a developer.

          A terminal based chess game written in ruby.  This
          was one of my favorite projects because of the 
          increasingly intricate classes needed to represent
          the pieces, and the sense of accomplishment when
          it finally came together.  Unfortunately, I am 
          still not very good at actually <em>playing</em> chess...

          A simple RPS game played in the browser.  I love to add

          When The Odin Project assinged this project I was
          still a baby coder and it absolutely amazed me how
          much could be accomplished with a little JS.  This project 
          still reminds me that no matter how much I understand, more
          is always possible.

      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>
        It's been a winding journey to arrive at web development.  
        I have always loved logic and problem-solving, which led me 
        to pursue mathematics in college.  But I was always drawn to 
        people, which led me to pursue teaching and eventually ministry, after college.  
        However, I reached a point where I needed to step away from 
        that line of work, and began searching for a new career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right away, my wife and other friends said I should look into 
        coding.  I was hesitant at first, but one day I took their advice 
        and discovered something that made sense for me.  In coding, 
        logical thinking and problem-solving worked together with a 
        person-centered motivation.  I was hooked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, a friend of mine introduced me to The Odin Project, and 
        I dove right in.  Working through courses and projects on my own 
        time while working odd-jobs to pay bills.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I have learned a lot on the journey, not the least of which being 
        how to google things I don't know.  Before coding I worked at 
        a bowling alley, amazon warehouse, a church, senior at home care, and even 
        did the gig economy thing as a personal shopper.  While I gained 
        a lot from those experiences, none of them made sense for me as 
        a life career.  With development, I believe I've found that.
